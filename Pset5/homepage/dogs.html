        <h1> Pomeranian</h1>
        <p>Descended from large sled dog breeds, the now-tiny Pomeranian has a long and interesting history. The
            foxy-faced dog, nicknamed “the little dog who thinks he can,” is compact, active, and capable of competing
            in agility and obedience or simply being a family friend.
        </p>
        <p>Pomeranians are 7 to 12 inches tall and weigh 3 to 7 pounds. Some litters have puppies that are throwbacks to
            the days when they were larger and grow to be 12 to 14 pounds or more. These puppies can be an excellent
            choice for families with children.Pomeranians often are suspicious of strangers and can bark a lot.
            Pomeranians can be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended.
            High heat and humidity can cause your Pom to become overheated and possibly have heat stroke. When your Pom
            is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating and take him inside immediately. They definitely
            are housedogs and should not be kept outdoors.</p>
        <p> The extroverted Pomeranian is smart and vivacious. He loves meeting new people and gets along well with
            other animals, although he sometimes thinks he's a lot bigger than he is. Don't let him challenge bigger
            dogs in his mistaken belief that he's their size or larger. Alert and inquisitive, Pomeranians make
            excellent watchdogs and will bark at anything out of the ordinary. Teach them to stop barking on command,
            though, or they might go on all day long. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including
            heredity, training, and socialization.
        </p>
        <h3>Personality:</h3>
        <p>Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them.
            Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy who's willing to sit nicely on your lap, not the one who's beating up
            his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Aggression and shyness aren't characteristics that
            your Pom puppy will outgrow. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's
            available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with.</p>
        <p>Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely
            strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.</p>

    <div>
        <h1> Greyhound</h1>
        <p>Greyhounds were originally bred as hunting dogs to chase hare, foxes, and deer. Canines in this dog breed can
            reach speeds of 40 to 45 miles per hour, making them the Ferraris of the dog world. Not surprisingly,
            Greyhounds made a name for themselves as racing dogs and are still used in racing today. They also
            participate in many other dog sports, including lure coursing, conformation, obedience, and agility. Beyond
            their grace and speed, people love them for their sweet, mild nature.</p>
        <p>
            One of the most ancient of breeds, Greyhounds probably originated in Egypt and have been prized throughout
            history. Historic figures who were captivated by this breed include Cleopatra, Queen Elizabeth I of England,
            and General Custer, who raced his dogs the day before he set off on his fateful trip to Little Big Horn. The
            patronage of the two queens led to Greyhound racing being dubbed the "Sport of Queens. Aside from its royal
            fans, there's a lot to love about the breed. The Greyhound combines a stately appearance with a friendly
            attitude toward people and other dogs. Loyal and affectionate with his family, he's not aggressive toward
            strangers, although he will let you know — through a bark or a subtle pricking of his small, folded ears —
            that someone's approaching your home.
        </p>
        <h3> Personality:</h3>
        <p>Greyhounds generally have a wonderful temperament, being friendly and non-aggressive, although some can be
            aloof toward strangers. Give them a treat, though, and they're likely to become a friend for life.</p>
        <p>
            They're intelligent and independent, even catlike in many ways. They do have a sensitive side and are quick
            to react to tensions in the home. They can become shy or timid with mistreatment, even if it's
            unintentional.
        </p>
        <p>
            Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies
            with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the
            middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the
            corner.

    <div>
        <h1> German Shepard</h1>
        <p><strong>German shepherd dogs reach a maximum of about 25 inches in height, and they weigh up to about 95
                pounds (41 kilograms).
            </strong></p>
        <p>
            He is a well-proportioned dog. The head is broad and tapers handsomely to a sharp muzzle. The ears are
            rather large and stand erect. The back is level and muscular, and the tail is bushy and curves downward. The
            coat is thick and rough and may be black, tan, black and tan or gray. The coat should be harsh and of medium
            length; however, long-coated individuals occur often.
        </p>
        <p>These cats are sensitive, expressive, and active. They love to play and are not the best cats to leave home
            alone. They prefer a companion–even another cat–to keep them company. If you can provide a Scottish Fold
            with the attention they crave and keep up with their needs, they just might be the new furry family member
            you’re looking for.</p>
        <h3>Personality:</h3>
        <p>German shepherd dogs get along well with children and other pets if raised with them, but in keeping with
            their guarding instincts, they tend to be leery of strangers. The breed is considered to be smart and easy
            to train. Some poorly bred German shepherd dogs can be high-strung and nervous. Coupled with poor
            socialization and inadequate training, over guarding and aggressive behavior are risks.</p>
