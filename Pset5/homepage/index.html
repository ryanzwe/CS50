        <h1> Siamese</h1>
        <p><strong>The Siamese is a long, elegant cat. The body is long, the neck is long, the legs and tail are
                long.</strong></p>
        <p>The breed is medium sized but nicely muscled.</p>
        <p>The Siamese is a cat of extremes. The head is a long triangle. The tall ears are set on the head to be a
            continuation of this triangle. The nose is long and straight. The legs are long and slender. The tail is
            long and tapers to a point. The eyes are almond shape and bright blue.</p>
        <p>The Siamese coat is short, glossy and lies close to the body. The beauty of the Siamese cat is the look of
            the slender body, the blue eyes and the contrast between the color on the body and the darker color of the
            extremities. This contrast is called color restriction, or, more commonly, pointing. The color of the fur on
            the ears, tail and feet are a different color than that of the body, and this darker color gradually blends
            into the lighter color of the body. The face also shows a mask of the same deeper point color. The mask
            covers the face, surrounds the eyes and covers the whisker pads. The mask is smaller in a kitten and
            gradually increases as she grows.</p>
        <h3>Personality:</h3>
        <p>The Siamese cat is not only beautiful, but also she is highly intelligent. She can be trained to walk on a
            lead. This intelligence does not mean, however, that she can be trained to do everything you might wish.
            Like most other highly intelligent breeds, the Siamese has her own desires.</p>
        <p>The Siamese is an affectionate cat and requires her parent to be as dedicated to her as she is to her parent.
            Her parent must be affectionate to the Siamese and make time to play with her.</p>

        <h1> Ginger</h1>
        <p><strong>Ginger cats or orange cats are very popular felines, though they’re not usually acknowledged as a
                distinct breed.</strong></p>
        <p>Even though, orange cats are among the cutest kittens in the world and are very common pets in many
            households. Most homes which own cats have, at some point, raised a ginger cat.</p>
        <p>Much like most Tabbies, Ginger cats very friendly and can make excellent pet cats. This kind of a kitten is
            very unique because of its striking orange shade.</p>
        <p>
            Many ginger tabbies will have a little black freckle around the mouth area and on their nose. This is usual
            after the first or second years of their lives.
        </p>

        <h1> Scottish Fold</h1>
        <p><strong>There is nothing a Scottish Fold–named for their folded ears–likes better than to be with their
                people, participating in whatever they are doing.
            </strong></p>
        <p>
            As the name implies, Scottish Folds come from Scotland, and they can all trace their ancestry back to a barn
            cat named Susie who had folded ears and worked as a mouser.
        </p>
        <p>These cats are sensitive, expressive, and active. They love to play and are not the best cats to leave home
            alone. They prefer a companion–even another cat–to keep them company. If you can provide a Scottish Fold
            with the attention they crave and keep up with their needs, they just might be the new furry family member
            you’re looking for.</p>
        <h3>Personality:</h3>
        <p>Gentle, intelligent and extremely well-adjusted, the Scottish Fold is also very affectionate. And though it
            can get very attached to its people, it will not be a pest or a nuisance. Like many other cats, it enjoys
            playing, but is especially responsive to training.</p>
