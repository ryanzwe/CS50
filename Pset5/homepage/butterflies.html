        <h1> Swallowtail Buttefly</h1>
        <p>The Dainty Swallowtail Butterfly is also known as the Dingy Swallowtail or Small Citrus Butterfly - but it
            isn't dingy at all. You'll see these stunning butterflies in flight across eastern Australia right up until
            May

            Adult Dainty Swallowtails are black with grey, white, and smaller blue and red spots on their wings, and
            yellow markings along their bodies. The female's wingspan is up to 7.2 cm while the male is slightly
            smaller, with his growing up to 6.7 cm. Their caterpillars eat the leaves of native and introduced citrus
            trees, and the butterflies feed on nectar from flowers.This gorgeous butterfly can be attracted to any
            garden within its range by planting caterpillar food plants such as native and introduced citrus. Adult
            females will only lay their eggs on new growth.
        </p>
        <p>The male patrols his territory around a food plant - their flight is often slow and lazy, but they can take
            off in a great hurry if disturbed.
            The caterpillar of the Dainty Swallowtail is blue-black in colour, with two rows of yellow-orange spots on
            its side and many small pale blue or white spots. It has two rows of short spines along its back.
            To protect themselves from predators, the caterpillars extend a bright red-orange forked organ from behind
            their heads called an 'osmeterium'. It emits strong and stinky chemicals smelling of citrus to deter
            predators that would otherwise easily eat an unprotected caterpillar
        </p>
        <h3>Did You Know?:</h3>
        <p>Dainty Swallowtail Butterflies are the smallest swallowtail butterflies in Australia..</p>

        <h1> Pieridae</h1>
        <p>The members of the Pieridae family are large butterflies and are characterised by their white or yellow
            colouring. There are around 700 species mostly native to tropical Africa and Asia.Some species have black
            spots and male and female differ often by their patterns and number of black markings.The larvae
            (caterpillars) of some of these species feed on brassicas, and are agricultural pests. Males of many species
            involve in gregarious mud-puddling. The family Pieridae has four subfamilies, of which the Whites and the
            Yellows are well represented:</p>
        <h3> Did You Know?:</h3>
        <p>The Pieridae have the radial vein on the forewing with three or four branches and rarely with five branches.
            The forelegs are well developed in both sexes, unlike in the Nymphalidae, and the tarsal claws are bifid,
            unlike in the Papilionidae.</p>
        <p>
            Like the Papilionidae, the Pieridae also have their pupae held at an angle by a silk girdle, but running at
            the first abdominal segment, unlike the thoracic girdle seen in the Papilionidae. But some species such as
            the madrone butterfly that belong to this family do not shows the presence of this abdominal silk girdle

        <h1>Apodemia</h1>
        <p> Apodemia mormo (Mormon metalmark) is a principally Nearctic butterfly in the family Riodinidae. It is a
            particularly fascinating species for ecological and evolutionary research, as evidenced by its shifting
            taxonomic classifications. Conflicting observations of host plants utilized, distinctive morphologies, and a
            wide range of occupied habitats have prompted investigation into several potential subspecies.[2] To date,
            two
            genetic studies have been done on A. mormo, with analysis revealing that disjunct populations are
            genetically
            and phenotypically distinct. These studies support a potential need for refined taxonomies, although a
            larger
            body of data is required to make clear decisions
        </p>
        <p>These cats are sensitive, expressive, and active. They love to play and are not the best cats to leave home
            alone. They prefer a companion–even another cat–to keep them company. If you can provide a Scottish Fold
            with the attention they crave and keep up with their needs, they just might be the new furry family member
            you’re looking for.</p>
        <h3>Did You Know?:</h3>
        <p>Soil disturbances, caused by human and railway traffic, are critical for the survival of host plants and
            subsequent A. mormo populations; however, overbearing human presence can lead to habitat destruction.
            Conservation statuses have been repeatedly defended by research, and recovery strategies developed in
            response.</p>
