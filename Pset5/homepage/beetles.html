        <h1>Ladybird</h1>
        <p>There are about 5,000 different species of ladybirds in the world. These much loved critters are also known
            as lady beetles or ladybugs, and in many cultures they’re considered good luck. They come in many different
            colours and patterns, but the most familiar in the UK is the seven-spot ladybird, which has a shiny,
            red-and-black body. Most people like ladybirds because they are pretty, graceful and harmless to humans. But
            farmers love them because they eat aphids and other plant-eating pests. And boy do they eat – in it’s
            year-long life, a single seven-spot ladybird can gobble more than 5000 aphids!
        </p>
        <p>Most ladybirds have oval, dome-shaped bodies with six short legs. Depending on the species, they can have
            spots, stripes or no markings at all. Seven-spotted ladybugs are red (or sometimes orange) with three spots
            on each side and one in the middle. Their head is black with white patches on either side.
        </p>
        <h3>Did You Know?:</h3>
        <p>Seven-spot ladybirds are native to Europe but were introduced to North America in the mid-1900s to control aphid populations.</p>

        <h1>Dung</h1>
        <p>Dung beetles have dark, round bodies, six legs and long flying wings folded under hard, protective covers. Some male dung beetles have strong horns on their heads, too. Found worldwide on every continent except Antartica, these brilliant bugs live in habitats ranging from hot, dry deserts to lush forests. And any ideas what these insects like to eat? Yup, you guessed it…dung or animal poop, as you might call it.</p>
        <p>
            There are three main types of dung beetle – rollers, tunnellers and dwellers – each named for the way the way the beetles use the poop they find. Rollers shape dung into balls and roll them away from the pile. They then burry the ball to either munch on later or to use as a place to lay their eggs.
        </p>
        <h3> Did You Know?:</h3>
        <p>Tunnellers dive into the dung pile, usually working in a ‘male-female’ pair, and dig a tunnel beneath it. The female beetle then stays in the tunnel sorting out the dung brought down by the male.</p>

        <h1>Stag Beetle</h1>
        <p>
            There are over 1,200 species of these big-jawed beetles in the world, and maybe even more than 85 different species just in Australia, but even though there are lots of different types of Stag Beetle, many are facing a loss of habitat that is threatening their survival. Stag Beetles love to live in damp woodland areas with lots of leaves and rotting wood on the ground, but unfortunately, these are also the kinds of areas that humans like to clear for houses, farming or to use for logging. Male Stag Beetles are easy to recognise because they have a great big jaw, like a pincer. The females can be a little trickier to spot. Many types of Stag Beetle are brown or black, but there are also a few really beautiful species, like the Rainbow Stag Beetle, that are very colourful. The Stag Beetle is a great friend to humans, playing a really important role in ridding forests and our gardens of rotting leaves, fruits and wood.
        </p>
        <p>Baby Stag Beetles are plump, c-shaped, cream coloured grubs, like most of their scarab beetle relatives. But you can tell if the baby scarab you find is a Stag Beetle by looking at its lower back. If it has two dark, hard, oval-shaped pads on its back, it's most likely a Stag Beetle baby.</p>
        <h3>Did You Know?:</h3>
        <p>Stag Beetles are nocturnal and they sometimes become attracted to bright outside lights, especially on warm nights.</p>
        <p>Some male Stag Beetles can live for two summer seasons.</p>
