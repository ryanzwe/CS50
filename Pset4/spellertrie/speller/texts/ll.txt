     FADE IN...

     A sun-blasted sky. We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after
     another...

     We're --

1    EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

     Cars are at a standstill. It's a horrific traffic jam.

     Morning rush hour. Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the
     heat. The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the
     distance.

     We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after
     another...

     One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another
     sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. We
     move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO,
     until finally we begin to hear...

     ...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN]

     We settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing.
     The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on
     her radio -- then starts SINGING.

     Then -- she EXITS her car. Then -- she starts MOVING down the
     lane.

     One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING
     along. Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL-
     FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER...

     Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making
     use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. Arms
     swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts.
     We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars,
     taking the magic in...

     Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles --
     and the song comes to a dramatic stop.

     Flash title card:

                              WINTER

A1   We settle on a new car. A 1983 Dodge Riviera. In it is
     SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. He's listening to the radio. He's
     playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious
     Monk's "Japanese Folk Song". But he keeps stopping it, over
     and over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot.
                              Revision                           2.


B1   OMIT

C1   We DRIFT from his car to one further up ahead. A light-green
     2005 Prius. Inside is MIA, 27, Nevada-raised. Six years of
     "no" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer.
     She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system.
     Fast, fiery, full of energy --

                            MIA
               ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked.
               It was pure insanity.

     Mia stops. Thinks. Mutters to herself: "Insanity"... Then
     leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger
     seat. It's a SCRIPT.

                            MIA (CONT'D)
                      (reading now)
               Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...

     Just then -- the traffic around Mia starts to let up. She's
     too focused on her lines to notice.

     Then -- a long, sustained honk behind her: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT.

     Mia comes to. Jerked back to reality. The honking car behind
     her swerves into the next lane. It's Sebastian. Mia gives him
     the finger. We then FOLLOW her as she drives...

4    INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     Mia works, photos of Hollywood icons on the wall behind her, as --

                            CUSTOMER #1
               This doesn't taste like almond milk.

                            MIA
               Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --

                            CUSTOMER #1
               Can I see the carton?

     Mia hands it over. The Customer looks.

                            CUSTOMER #1 (CONT'D)
               I'll have a black coffee.

     Mia gets the coffee. Quickly sneaks a look at a script hidden
     underneath her counter. The same one we saw in her car...
                               Revision                          3.


    She hands the coffee to the Customer. We follow the Customer
    out through the door -- as a WOMAN walks into the shop. We
    don't see the Woman's face, but we see all the eyes in the
    shop turn immediately to her. We see one CUSTOMER whisper to
    another, discreetly pointing as the WOMAN passes by...

                           WOMAN
              Cappuccino, please.

    Mia nods. Gets it made. The Manager takes it from her.

                           MANAGER
              On us.

                           WOMAN
              No, I insist.

    She pays. Then smiles at Mia and drops a bill in the tip jar.
    Mia watches as the Woman walks off, is joined by a STUDIO
    EMPLOYEE on a golf cart outside -- we realize this coffee shop
    is on a STUDIO LOT -- and is driven away...

    Then -- Mia's phone rings. It reads: "MOM". Mia presses
    "IGNORE" and the time pops up on the phone's screen: 4:07.

                           MIA
              Shit.

    Removing her apron and hurrying out, turning back as --

                           MANAGER
              Where do you think you're going?

                           MIA
              It's -- five past...

                           MANAGER
              You'd better be here early tomorrow.

                           MIA
              Ok.

    -- then realizes she doesn't have her script, runs back to
    grab it, hurries on and then -- CRASHES into a table. Coffee
    and food spill all over her shirt, and all at once we're --

5   INT. AUDITION ROOM - DAY

    Mia's in a thick winter coat, covering her stained shirt. On
    her cell, loudly laughing while her adrenaline surges --

                           MIA (CONT'D)
              And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It
              was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...
                                Revision                      4.


    Her nerves are practically visible. As she talks, we PULL
    BACK -- to see that she's auditioning for a CASTING DIRECTOR.

                           MIA (CONT'D)
              No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you
              waiting `til Denver to tell her...?
                     (as her smile contracts)
              Oh. I see...
                     (silence; she clenches her jaw...)
              No, you're right. I understand.
                     (...and a tear falls from her eye)
              Ok... I just... Oh...

    An ASSISTANT appears through the glass on the door behind
    Mia, waving to the Casting Director: Yoohoo. Can I come in?

                           MIA (CONT'D)
                     (crying now)
              No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --

                            CASTING DIRECTOR
              One second.

    Mia stops. The Casting Director waves the Assistant in. The
    Assistant scurries in, shows her boss a post-it. Mia stands
    there, trying to hold onto the tears, hold onto the emotion, as
    the Casting Director reads the post-it and thinks.

                           CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
              ...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost
              done in here.

    The Assistant nods. Walks out. Mia waits, trying to maintain...

                           CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
              You know what? I think we're good. Thanks
              for coming in.

    Mia looks at her. A beat.

6   INT. LOBBY - DAY

    Mia exits. Nerves still on edge. Passes one beautiful redhead
    after the next -- all getting ready to cry.

    Enters the elevator with two other WOMEN -- tall, statuesque.
    Also redheads.

7   INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

    Mia enters. Exhausted. Heads to her ROOM.
                             Revision                          5.


    Old movie posters hang on the walls, including a big Ingrid
    Bergman one over the bed. There's also a shelf filled with
    acting books -- Uta Hagen, Stella Adler. Various other
    trinkets: an old globe, an old blue-and-red suitcase. Mia
    takes off her shoe. A blister on her sole.

8   WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a
    towel. She hums to herself.

    The mirror is fogged up. She turns off the vent. The mist on
    the glass thickens. She dabs some of it away. Dims the
    lights. Looks...

    With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those
    soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. She hums as she brushes
    her hair...

    Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken.

                           TRACY
              Holy Mother of God.

    Mia snaps out of it. Turns. Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27.

                           TRACY (CONT'D)
              Ever heard of a vent?

                           MIA
              I wanted to give you an entrance.

                           ALEXIS
                     (appearing in the hall, 26,
                      eating Cheetos)
              Mia! How'd it go?

                           MIA
              Eh...

                           ALEXIS
              Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?

                           MIA
              I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.

                           ALEXIS
              They're the worst.

                           MIA
              I don't know if they were there.

    As Mia slips away --

                           ALEXIS
              I bet they were.
                               Revision                           6.


                            CAITLIN
                      (appearing, 27)
               Why is there a convention in the bathroom?

                            TRACY
               Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming,
               right?

     WE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom --

                            MIA
               Can't. Working.

                             TRACY (O.S.)
               What?
                      (we PAN BACK to Tracy)
               Did she say "working"?

A8   We follow Mia INSIDE her room. She closes the door. Takes a
     moment. You can tell in her eyes -- work or not, a night on
     the town is the last thing she wants to do now.

B8   WE CUT to the HALLWAY, to find Tracy POUNDING on Mia's door.

                             MIA
                       (opening up)
               Yes?

                            TRACY
               Look, I know things didn't go well today.
               There are four things in my inbox that
               you're perfect for and I will submit you.
               But right now -- you're coming.

C8   With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet --

                            TRACY (CONT'D)
               It'll be fun.

                            MIA
               It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed
               into one of those glass houses.

                            TRACY
               Exactly. Fun.

     She pulls out a blue dress. As Alexis hurries in --

            TRACY (CONT'D)                        MIA
     This looks familiar.             I was going to give it
                                      back!

     Alexis moves from Mia's perfume to the dress, lighting up as
     she grabs it --
                               Revision                           7.


                             ALEXIS
                Come on, Mia. When else do you get to
                see every Hollywood cliché crammed
                into a single home?

                             TRACY
                       (faux-offended)
                Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's
                nothing to make fun of. This party will
                be humanity at its finest.

      Mia rolls her eyes -- and, with that --

      Tracy BREAKS INTO SONG. [SOMEONE IN THE CROWD]

      She play-acts the clichés this party will represent. Alexis
      and Caitlin join in, giddy and playful. Mia can't help but
      laugh. The roommates sing and dance, hoping to persuade Mia
      to join the night's revelry...

      Mia remains reluctant. Stays behind in her room as her
      roommates head out the door. But she's starting to wonder: A
      night at home, feeling sorry for herself -- or a night out
      with her friends...?

9     EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING / STREET - NIGHT

      We're outside now, and BACK with Tracy, Alexis and Caitlin,
      marching across the courtyard and toward the street. They
      sing, dance, half-assuming Mia is a no-go --

      -- until Mia APPEARS, blue-dress-clad. Her roommates look at
      her in surprise -- then delight. The energy swells and the
      four characters dance their way together down the street.
      They dive into a single CAR, and WE DISSOLVE TO...

10    OMIT.

A10   OMIT.

11    EXT. CITY - NIGHT

      An old-fashioned MONTAGE of a night on the town: neon signs
      and overflowing champagne glasses. Soon enough, we're at...

12    EXT. MODERN HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT

      Valet cars lined up. We FOLLOW Alexis, Tracy, Caitlin and Mia
      to the door...

13    INT./EXT. HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT

      ...and into a big-glass hilltop pad. We FOLLOW Mia as she
      takes in her surroundings.
                                 Revision                          8.


      A D.J. turning tables. A FAT OLD PRODUCER dancing with a
      TWENTY-SOMETHING. A trio of AGENTS glad-handing each other in
      rhythm by the bar. Yep -- every cliché is here...

      Mia tries talking to a pair of WOMEN -- who promptly ditch
      her.

      Seeing she's now alone, a YOUNG MAN swoops in to hit on her.

      She makes a hasty exit toward the bar -- but the line's
      obscenely long.

      She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way,
      making out.

      She slips in behind them...

A13   Inside the BATHROOM, Mia takes a moment. The joy of seconds
      ago is gone from her eyes now. She gazes into the mirror --

      -- and SINGS by herself.

      This verse, sung in private, belongs to a new style: less
      brash, and far more vulnerable...

      Once finished, Mia takes a breath, steels herself to once
      again face the world, opens the door -- and rejoins the
      crowd...

B13   We MOVE with her slowly now -- surrounded by the party, but
      everything set at a snail's pace, the crazed carousers moving
      in SLOW MOTION. It's the sadness underneath the revelry, the
      pain underneath the clichés...

      Gradually we RAMP UP. Follow Mia OUTSIDE, where we see the
      splash of blue-green that is the POOL -- and a flurry of FAKE
      SNOW falling from above...

      As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps --

      -- and we PLUNGE WITH HIM INTO THE POOL.

      This is the climax of the number. Everyone joins in,
      circling the pool -- a swath of color against the black sky.
      Everyone dances, everyone sings -- and the song concludes
      with a blast of fireworks.

A14   EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Close on a sign: "NO PARKING ANYTIME: TOW-AWAY ZONE".

                             MIA (O.S.)
                No...

      We see Mia -- all alone, staring at the sign. No car in
      sight. She reaches into her purse, pulls out her cell phone
      to call Tracy. It's dead.

                             MIA (CONT'D)
                No...

19    EXT. HILL / LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT

      Mia trudges down the steep hill in her unwieldy heels. She's an
      hour-and-a-half walk from her place. She crosses roads and lots,
      navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to
      shrubbery.

A19   And then -- she hears something... Music. A piano, in the
      distance. And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well...

      Without being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several
      doors. Then stops. Has found where it's coming from...

      She reaches out -- and slowly opens a door...

      AND WE CUT RIGHT BACK TO:

20    EXT. 101 FREEWAY - EARLIER THAT MORNING

      AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. The same 101 traffic jam we began
      with. This time we're on Sebastian -- the honker.

      He passes Mia's car. She gives him the finger. He drives on,
      shaking his head...

21    OMIT

22    EXT. RAYO'S - MOMENTS LATER

      Sebastian sips a coffee as he gazes across the street -- at
      a 30's Deco building. A sign above the door: "VAN BEEK". A
      newer sub-heading below: "TAPAS & TUNES".
                               Revision                          10.



      The door opens. Two EMPLOYEES step out, setting up a valet
      stand. Sebastian watches them -- and shakes his head. The
      employees notice him. Recognize him. What is it with that
      guy...?

23A   OMIT

23    INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

      Sebastian enters his apartment -- cramped, dingy, bare
      walls, no furniture or decoration, boxes filled with dusty
      black-and-white photographs and unused instruments on the
      floor, a black Steinway upright piano in the center of the
      living room -- and sees a WOMAN rummaging around.

                             SEBASTIAN
                You gotta stop breaking into my home.

      She looks up. She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like
      she doesn't care. This is LAURA, Sebastian's older sister.

                             LAURA
                You think Mom or Dad would call this a
                home?

      Seeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool --

                             SEBASTIAN
                Please don't sit on that.

                             LAURA
                Are you serious?

                             SEBASTIAN
                Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool.
                The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.

                             LAURA
                I wonder why.
                       (then, rising,)
                I brought you this. It's a throw rug.

                             SEBASTIAN
                Don't need it.

                             LAURA
                Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis
                pissed on it?

                             SEBASTIAN
                That's almost insulting...
                       (then,)
                Did he?
                         Revision                        11.


She shakes her head: Unbelievable. Tosses the rug to the side.

                       LAURA
          When are you going to unpack these boxes?

                       SEBASTIAN
          When I unpack them in my club.

                       LAURA
          Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with
          you and you're stalking her.
                 (then, looks at him --)
          You're not still going by there, are you?

                       SEBASTIAN
          No.

A beat. Then --

                       SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          They've turned it into a tapas-samba
          place. You believe that?

                       LAURA
          Seb --

                       SEBASTIAN
          Who wants to tapas while they samba?

                       LAURA
          I have someone I want you to meet.

                       SEBASTIAN
          I don't want to meet anyone.

                       LAURA
          You'll like her.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?

                       LAURA
          Probably not.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Then what are we gonna talk about?

                       LAURA
          You'll talk about the weather.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to
          meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart
          of gold.
                           Revision                      12.


                         LAURA
          Sebastian --

                       SEBASTIAN
          How long's it been?

                       LAURA
          You need to get serious. You live like a
          hermit. You're driving without insurance.

                       SEBASTIAN
          I am serious. I had a very serious plan
          for my future. It's not my fault I got
          Shanghai'ed.

                       LAURA
          You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got
          ripped off.

                       SEBASTIAN
          What's the difference?

                       LAURA
          It's not as romantic as that.
                 (she starts to walk off)
          And everyone knew that guy was shady
          except for you.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty
          word?

                       LAURA
          Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.

She heads to the door. He follows her, won't give it up --

                       SEBASTIAN
          You're acting like life's got me on the
          ropes -- what you don't understand is, I
          want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life
          hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna
          make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope.

Laura can't help but laugh. Stops by the door. Looks at him.

                       LAURA
          I love you. Unpack your boxes.

                       SEBASTIAN
          I'm changing the locks.
                                  Revision                       13.


                             LAURA
                       (out the door with a smile --)
                You can't afford it.

      She's gone. Sebastian thinks for a beat, then calls out --

                             SEBASTIAN
                I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes!

      No reply to his triumphant declaration. He shuts the door.
      Looks again at the napkin. Thinks. Tosses it in the trash.

A23   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER

      Moments later. Sebastian takes a slice of pizza from the
      fridge, pours himself some more coffee, places a Thelonious
      Monk LP onto a record player, and sits down at the piano.

      "Japanese Folk Song" -- the piece we heard in his car --
      plays...

      Sebastian plays along. Stops. Moves the record back a few
      bars. Starts it again. Plays the same passage over. Stops.
      Moves the record back a second time. Plays the passage again.
      Stops. Over and over, just like in his car -- until, finally,
      he gets it right.

      He keeps playing, louder now, and we're --

27    INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      A red-booth bar-and-restaurant. Christmas decorations all over.
      Sebastian steps in. Immediately beelining over --

                                BOSS
                Seb.

                             SEBASTIAN
                       (putting on a smile)
                Bill. Thanks for having me back.

                             BOSS
                Your welcome. Stick to the set list.
